# Next.js API Route Error Handling and Client-Side Fallback

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where an API route may return a 500 error, and the client-side component doesn't handle this gracefully.  The example shows how to improve error handling on both the server and client sides.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` route simulates an API that randomly returns a 500 error. The client-side component (`components/MyComponent.js`) fetches data from this API but doesn't handle the error case effectively.  This leads to a broken user experience when the API returns an error.

## Solution

The solution involves improving error handling in both the API route and the client-side component.  The API route should return more informative error messages, and the client-side component should handle the error gracefully and provide feedback to the user.
